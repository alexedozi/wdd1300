    <h2>Alexander Edozie Onyekwere</h2>
    <p>My name is Brother Alexander Edozie Onyekwere and 
        i'm currently enrolled in an online degree,
       hopefully to succeed in wdd130 and progress further
        in more advance courses in byu, i am from Nigeria 
        and reside in South Africa and the reason am taking courses is to 
       learn new concept in web design, though i have not done this 
       before but i beleive that by the mercy of our Heavenly Father i will succeed.
    </p>
    <p>Something unique about me is, i am a very shy person , i love the gospel
        of Jesus Christ and i am the child of our Heaven Father.</p>
